# MiniScape Implementation Summary

## Areas and Zones
We implemented several key areas in the game world:

- **Lumbridge (Starter Town)**: A safe zone with basic resource nodes for new players.
- **Wilderness (PvP-Enabled Zone)**: A dangerous area where high-value resources can be found.
- **Grand Exchange (Trading Hub)**: A central marketplace area where players can trade with each other.
- **Barbarian Village (Mining Area)**: An area focused on mining with various ore types.

Each zone has defined boundaries and visual indicators. The Wilderness provides a warning message when entered to alert players to the danger.

## Skill Systems
We implemented three core gathering skills:

### Fishing
- Created fishing spots in water areas with different fish types
- Implemented fishing mechanics that use the `gather` socket event
- Added animation and sound effects for feedback
- Created different fishing tools and spot types with varying requirements
- Implemented XP rewards and level progression

### Woodcutting
- Added various tree types (normal, oak, willow, maple, yew) with different requirements
- Implemented tree depletion and respawn mechanics
- Created woodcutting tools (bronze, iron, steel axes)
- Added interaction mechanics with socket communication
- Implemented sound effects and animations
- Added XP rewards and level progression

### Mining
- Added different ore rock types (copper, tin, iron, coal, gold, mithril)
- Implemented rock depletion and respawn mechanics
- Created mining tools (bronze, iron, steel pickaxes)
- Added mining interaction mechanics
- Implemented sound effects and visual feedback
- Added XP rewards and level progression

## Core Game Systems

### Skills Panel
- Created a comprehensive skills panel UI that shows all skills
- Implemented XP calculation and level progression
- Added progress bars and detailed information for each skill
- Designed a clean and intuitive interface

### Sound System
- Implemented a versatile sound manager
- Added sound effects for different actions (mining, woodcutting, fishing)
- Created categories with volume controls
- Implemented sound toggling functionality

### Resource System
- Created a flexible resource node system
- Added metadata support for different resource types
- Implemented visuals for normal and depleted resources
- Added LOD (Level of Detail) for performance optimization

## Technical Architecture
The implementation follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client**: Handles rendering, user input, and visual feedback
- **Server**: Acts as the authoritative source for game state
- **Socket Communication**: Used for real-time updates and actions

Resource interactions follow this pattern:
1. Player clicks on a resource
2. Client sends a `gather` event to the server
3. Server validates the action and updates the game state
4. Server broadcasts updates to all relevant clients
5. Client provides visual and audio feedback

The skills system uses this pattern:
1. Server determines if an action is successful
2. Server calculates XP rewards and updates player skills
3. Server sends updates to the client
4. Client updates the UI and provides feedback

## Future Improvements
Some areas that could be enhanced in the future:

- Implement combat system for PvP in the Wilderness
- Create a more sophisticated trading system for the Grand Exchange
- Add NPCs for more interactive gameplay
- Implement more social features like friends lists and chat channels
- Optimize resource loading for better performance
- Add more detailed tutorials for new players
